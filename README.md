Sentiment analysis model for Iloilo City tourist attraction reviews, trained using TensorFlow in Google Colab.

This repository contains the sentiment analysis model developed for a mobile crowdsourcing-based application focused on tourist attractions in Iloilo City, Philippines. The model was trained using Google Colab and TensorFlow, with the goal of classifying tourist feedback into positive and negative sentiments.

Purpose: This model is part of a research project aiming to support local tourism development through data-driven sentiment analysis. The insights generated from user feedback are intended to help the Iloilo City Tourism and Development Office make informed decisions and improve visitor experiences.

How to Use: 
1. Open the .ipynb file using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Review or modify the preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.
3. You may use transfer learning to fine-tune the model with actual reviews from Iloilo tourists for more contextual accuracy.
4. Export the model in .tflite format for mobile application integration.
